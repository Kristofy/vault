# Levels of hardware concurrency

### 1. **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) Level**
- **Description:** The ALU is responsible for performing arithmetic and logical operations. Multiple instructions can be executed concurrently if the ALU is not occupied.
- **Techniques:**
  - **Pipelining:** Breaking down an instruction into several stages (fetch, decode, execute, etc.), allowing multiple instructions to be processed simultaneously at different stages.
  - **Superscalar Execution:** Multiple ALUs within a single CPU core allow for multiple instructions to be executed in parallel.

  - Multiple ALUs, FPUs and SIMD units

### 2. **CPU Core Level**
- **Description:** Concurrency achieved within a single CPU core.
- **Techniques:**
  - **Pipelining:** As mentioned above, allows for overlapping stages of multiple instructions.
  - **Out-of-Order Execution:** Instructions are executed as resources are available, not strictly in program order.
  - **Branch Prediction:** Improves the efficiency of pipelining by guessing the path of a branch to avoid pipeline stalls.
  - **Hyper-Threading/Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT):** Multiple threads are executed within a single core by duplicating certain parts of the processor (like registers) but sharing the execution units.

### 3. **CPU Cache Level**
- **Description:** Fast memory located close to the CPU cores to reduce the time to access frequently used data.
- **Techniques:**
  - **Multi-level Caches (L1, L2, L3):** Different levels of cache with varying sizes and speeds to optimize access time.
  - **Cache Coherence Protocols:** Ensures that multiple caches (in multi-core systems) have the most recent data.

### 4. **Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD)**
- **Description:** A form of parallelism where a single instruction operates on multiple data points simultaneously.
- **Techniques:**
  - **Vector Processing:** Performing the same operation on a vector of data.
  - **Graphics Processing Units (GPUs):** Highly parallel processors designed for handling multiple data streams efficiently.

### 5. **Multi-Core Processor Level**
- **Description:** Concurrency achieved by having multiple CPU cores on a single chip.
- **Techniques:**
  - **Multi-core CPUs:** Multiple independent cores that can execute instructions concurrently.
  - **Inter-core Communication:** Efficient methods for cores to communicate and share data.

### 6. **Multi-Processor System Level**
- **Description:** Systems with multiple physical processors.
- **Techniques:**
  - **Symmetric Multiprocessing (SMP):** Multiple processors share the same memory and I/O resources.
  - **Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA):** Each processor has its own local memory, but can access memory from other processors with some penalty.

### 7. **Cache Coherence and Memory Models**
- **Description:** Techniques ensuring data consistency across multiple caches and memory accesses.
- **Techniques:**
  - **MESI Protocol (Modified, Exclusive, Shared, Invalid):** A widely used cache coherence protocol.
  - **Memory Consistency Models:** Define the order in which memory operations appear to be performed.

### 8. **Instruction-Level Parallelism (ILP)**
- **Description:** Extracting parallelism from a single instruction stream.
- **Techniques:**
  - **Superscalar Architectures:** Multiple instructions per clock cycle using multiple execution units.
  - **VLIW (Very Long Instruction Word):** Encoding multiple operations in a single instruction.

### 9. **Data-Level Parallelism (DLP)**
- **Description:** Parallelism achieved by distributing data across multiple processing units.
- **Techniques:**
  - **Array Processing:** Operations performed on arrays of data.
  - **SIMD Extensions (e.g., SSE, AVX):** Extensions to the instruction set that allow SIMD operations.

### 10. **Thread-Level Parallelism (TLP)**
- **Description:** Achieved by running multiple threads in parallel.
- **Techniques:**
  - **Multi-threading:** Running multiple threads on a single core or multiple cores.
  - **Task Parallelism:** Decomposing a program into tasks that can be executed in parallel.

### 11. **Pipeline Parallelism**
- **Description:** Dividing a task into stages and processing different stages concurrently.
- **Techniques:**
  - **Assembly Line Processing:** Different stages of a task are handled by different processing units concurrently.

### 12. **Memory Level Parallelism (MLP)**
- **Description:** Achieving concurrency by overlapping multiple memory operations.
- **Techniques:**
  - **Prefetching:** Loading data into cache before it is actually needed.
  - **Non-blocking Caches:** Allowing multiple outstanding memory requests.

### 13. **Speculative Execution**
- **Description:** Executing instructions before it is known whether they will be needed, to keep the pipeline busy.
- **Techniques:**
  - **Branch Prediction:** Guessing the outcome of a branch to continue execution without waiting.

### 14. **Asynchronous Parallelism**
- **Description:** Operations that occur without waiting for previous operations to complete.
- **Techniques:**
  - **Event-driven Programming:** Using events to trigger asynchronous operations.
  - **Message Passing:** Processes communicate by sending messages, allowing for concurrent operations.
